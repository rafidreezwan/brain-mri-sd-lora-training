# Brain MRI LoRA Fine-Tuning (Stable Diffusion)

This is an **ongoing research project** where we fine-tune Stable Diffusion
using a custom Brain MRI dataset to generate medically-consistent synthetic MRI images.

## 🎯 Goal
- Fine-tune SD-v1.5 using LoRA on Brain MRI scans  
- Generate realistic MRI-style images for augmentation & research  
- Build towards a research-ready experimental pipeline  

## 📂 Current Progress
- Dataset cleaned & verified — ✅  
- JSONL metadata prepared — ✅  
- Training pipeline debugging in Kaggle — 🚧 Ongoing  
- LoRA training run — 🔜 Next step  

## 🧠 Notebook
All project work so far is inside:

- `brain_mri_lora_training_notebook.ipynb`

## ⚠️ Note
The **dataset images are not uploaded** due to size & sensitivity.
Only metadata and training workflow are shared.

## 📌 Status
This project is a **work in progress** and will be updated as experiments continue.
